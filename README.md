## sympan - Python library for downloading anything from S3

This is a simple Python library for downloading any content from S3, locally.
It is based on boto3 and joblib. It is really a simple library,
but it is very useful. It uses parallel programming in Python,
as well as boto3.client and boto3.resource. 

## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.7 installed.

```bash install.sh``` will do the job.

```
pip install "sympan@git+https://github.com/alem88/sympan@0.1.0"

```

will also do the job if you don't want to clone it first.



## Usage


```

from sympan.handlers import S3Handler

from credentials import (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
                         AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
                         REGION_NAME)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s3 = S3Handler(aws_access_key_id=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
                   aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
                   region_name=REGION_NAME)

    s3.download_locally(s3_url= "s3://url/path/to/folder/or/file/",
                        destination_folder="local/path/to/destination/folder",
                        n_jobs=2)
```
Here credentials.py and config.py are two files where you 
need to put appropriate information from the demo. The structure in 
destination folder will be the same as in S3 url. Try it! :)
